Project Overview
This ticket management system provides a visual way to track tickets through their lifecycle. The application focuses on user experience with smooth animations, intuitive drag-and-drop functionality, and a clean, modern design.

The system uses a kanban-style board with five columns representing different ticket statuses: Assigned, In Process, Resolved, Deployed, and Closed. Users can easily move tickets between these statuses by dragging and dropping them.

The application is fully responsive and works well on mobile devices, tablets, and desktop computers.
